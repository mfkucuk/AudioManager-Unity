# AudioManager-Unity
An easy to use audio manager for Unity

How to use:
Create an empty GameObject and attach the "AudioManager" script and an Audio Source component to it.
You can create SoundEffect or Music scriptable objects and put them into the GameObject.
You can add Audio Clip to the scriptable objects and modify sound-related attributes.

Use "PlayMusic" to play music and "PlaySoundEffect" to play a sound effect with the name you've given.
